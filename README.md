# jason-voice-ai
Jason is a project for school, do not take it seriously, it is still in development.

# Parameters
You can put your own API key in `jason.py` to make it work, also, in the folder `images` you can introduce details about the faces you want to recognize and give the prompt details about the people you want Jason to recognize so he can know how they are and how to answer them.

# Running
Run `jason.py` once you saved the encodings in a pickle file so it doesn't have to encode all the images each time you run the assistant.
